# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

### The possible outcomes are:

Rock destroys scissors.

Scissors cut paper.

Paper covers rock.

If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.
